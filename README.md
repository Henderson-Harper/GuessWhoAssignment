Guess Who Assignment

Made for my Grade 12 Computer Science final project. 
This project was a 3-person group project. 
We also had supporting work for design and project management.

I personally made the "AI" - it ranks the guesses by how optimal they are and then the randomness score makes it choose how random the guess will be.
I also contributed to the design process as well, helping to design how the different objects would work and interact with each other.
Page design and bugfixing were also areas I greatly contributed to.
